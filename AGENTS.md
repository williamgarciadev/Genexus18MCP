Project-level instructions for AI assistants working on Genexus18MCP.

## Project orient

Two-process MCP server that exposes a GeneXus 18 Knowledge Base to AI agents (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) via the native GeneXus SDK — no parsing of KB files, no scraped IDE state, edits go through the same code paths the IDE uses. Codebase is C# / .NET for everything that touches the SDK; the npm package (`genexus-mcp`) is a thin Node wrapper shipping pre-built Windows binaries and writing MCP-client config.

```
MCP client (Claude/Cursor/…)
   │   stdio JSON-RPC
   ▼
GxMcp.Gateway  (long-running, one per client)
   │   pipes JSON-RPC over stdio
   ▼
GxMcp.Worker   (one per opened KB; STA thread; hosts Artech.* SDK in-process)
   │   COM-flavoured SDK calls
   ▼
GeneXus 18 SDK  (C:\Program Files (x86)\GeneXus\GeneXus18\Artech.*.dll)
   ▼
Knowledge Base on disk
```

- **Gateway** (`src/GxMcp.Gateway/`, **net8.0-windows**) — speaks MCP stdio with the client, owns a `WorkerPool` indexed by KB alias, routes tool calls through `Routers/*.cs` to a per-KB worker. `Program.cs` is the MCP loop + `whoami` builder + worker lifecycle.
- **Worker** (`src/GxMcp.Worker/`, **net48 STA**) — owns the GeneXus SDK in-process. STA thread is mandatory because the SDK is COM-flavoured. `Services/CommandDispatcher.cs` is the RPC switchboard; `KbService` opens KBs; `IndexCacheService` maintains an on-disk `SearchIndex` cache; `Services/{ListService,SearchService,AnalyzeService,WriteService,…}` implement the tools.
- **CLI** (`cli/run.js`) — what `npx genexus-mcp` invokes. Reads MCP client configs (Claude Desktop, Codex, Cursor, VS Code), writes the server entry pointing at `publish/start_mcp.bat`, then forwards stdio to the gateway. Tests are pure Node (`cli/run.test.js`).
- **publish/** — the deployable artifact. Both `install.ps1` (build-from-source) and `npm publish` (via `publish.zip`) ship from this directory. `GxMcp18.Gateway.exe` at the root, `worker/GxMcp18.Worker.exe` one level down. This layout is asserted by the npm-publish workflow.

### Tool surface lives in two synchronized places

- `src/GxMcp.Gateway/tool_definitions.json` — single source of truth for MCP tool schemas. `ToolSchemaSizeTests` enforces a token budget; bumping the constant requires a `CHANGELOG.md` entry recording the new value and why (the test itself only keeps the last few bumps for quick context).
- `src/GxMcp.Gateway.Tests/Fixtures/Contract/Discovery/tools-list.response.json` — golden fixture for the discovery `tools/list` envelope. **Must stay alphabetically sorted by tool name.** When you add/change a schema field in `tool_definitions.json`, regenerate the corresponding section in the golden fixture or the contract test fails.

### Adding or modifying a tool

The dispatch path goes: gateway router (`src/GxMcp.Gateway/Routers/*Router.cs`) ↔ worker dispatcher (`src/GxMcp.Worker/Services/CommandDispatcher.cs`). To add a tool: schema in `tool_definitions.json` → router case → dispatcher action → service method → golden fixture update.

**AxiCompact projection:** `genexus_query` and `genexus_list_objects` default to a compact field allowlist defined in `Program.GetDefaultCompactFields`. Adding a field to a tool's output also requires whitelisting it there, or it gets stripped before reaching the client.

## Build / test commands

Set this once per shell when working with Worker code (build-time reference path):

```powershell
$env:GX_PATH = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GeneXus\GeneXus18'
```

### Build

```powershell
.\build.ps1                                  # full Gateway+Worker build + deploy to publish/
dotnet build Genexus18MCP.sln -v:minimal     # quick solution build (no publish/ refresh)
dotnet build src\GxMcp.Worker\GxMcp.Worker.csproj
dotnet build src\GxMcp.Gateway\GxMcp.Gateway.csproj
```

If the build fails with `MSB3027` / `MSB3021` citing `GxMcp18.Gateway.exe` or `GxMcp18.Worker.exe` locked, the running dev gateway/worker is holding the binary — see the "Kill the Gateway/Worker" permission below.

### Test

```powershell
dotnet test src\GxMcp.Worker.Tests\GxMcp.Worker.Tests.csproj      # net48;  ~1,790 tests
dotnet test src\GxMcp.Gateway.Tests\GxMcp.Gateway.Tests.csproj    # net8.0;   ~760 tests
dotnet test Genexus18MCP.sln                                     # both
npm test                                                          # cli tests only (node --test)

# Single test or filter
dotnet test src\GxMcp.Worker.Tests\GxMcp.Worker.Tests.csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TemporalListTests"
dotnet test ...csproj --filter "FullyQualifiedName=GxMcp.Worker.Tests.TemporalListTests.SortByLastUpdate_OrdersDescending"
```

Known flaky in parallel runs: `EdgeCaseRegressionTests.Dispatcher_PatchApply_ValidateOnly_MapsToDryRun_ViaConvention`, sometimes `PatternApplyServiceTests.*` — all pass in isolation. Treat a single failure as a flake until you reproduce it isolated.

### Reload a running worker without restarting the MCP client

After editing Worker code, you can hot-swap the running worker:

- From inside any MCP session: `genexus_worker_reload mode=hard sourceDir=C:\Projetos\Genexus18MCP\src\GxMcp.Worker\bin\Debug`
- Force-kill path (use when worker is wedged and not responding): `genexus_worker_reload mode=soft force=true`

After a worker-reload the gateway's pipe handle can go stale — if the next call returns `Worker for KB '…' crashed/exited`, reconnect MCP via `/mcp` (Claude Code) once.

### Iterate against a running gateway over HTTP (default dev loop — no client restart)

The gateway serves a Streamable-HTTP MCP endpoint on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/mcp`
alongside the stdio link (port from `Server.HttpPort`, default 5000; loopback needs no
token). **Prefer driving this endpoint over asking the user to restart their MCP client
for every change** — a client restart and an HTTP call reach the same running gateway, so
the HTTP path is the default way to live-iterate.

- **Handshake:** `POST /mcp` with `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` and an
  `initialize` request; reuse the `MCP-Session-Id` response header on every later call.
  Tool results come back as `result.content[0].text` holding the worker's JSON (parse twice
  — it's JSON-in-JSON).
- **No gateway up?** Launch one: `publish/start_mcp.bat` (or the client's own). On stdin EOF
  a detached gateway stays alive (`Program.cs` falls into `Task.Delay(-1)`), so the HTTP
  endpoint keeps serving. Then open a KB with `genexus_kb action=open path=<kb>`.
- After editing Worker code, hot-swap via `genexus_worker_reload` (above); over HTTP the
  reload survives even when the stdio `/mcp` link would need a reconnect.

## Continuous CHANGELOG maintenance (Mandatory)

- **Immediate Unreleased logging:** Every completed bugfix, feature, performance improvement, or architectural change MUST immediately be added to `CHANGELOG.md` under the `## Unreleased` section as soon as implementation is verified.
- **Format:** Group entries under `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, or `### Internal` with clear descriptions of what was improved/fixed and why.

## Release protocol (Mandatory on user release request)

Whenever the user requests a release (e.g. "cria release", "corta release", "faz release"):
1. **Always cut BOTH GitHub Release AND publish to npm (`genexus-mcp`).**
2. **Standard release execution:** Run `.\release.ps1 -Version <X.Y.Z>` (or execute build → bump versions in `package.json`, `.csproj`, `CHANGELOG.md` → pack `publish.zip` using normalized forward slashes → write `publish.zip.sha256` → commit & tag `vX.Y.Z` → `gh release create` → `gh release upload publish.zip`).
3. **Automated npm publish verification:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) triggers on release/upload of `publish.zip` and publishes `genexus-mcp` to npm via OIDC. Always verify workflow completion with `gh run list --workflow release.yml` and `npm view genexus-mcp@latest version`.
4. **Strict Issue closure rule:** GitHub issues MUST ONLY be closed after a release containing the fix/change is cut and published with a release link. Comment on each resolved issue with the release link (`https://github.com/lennix1337/Genexus18MCP/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`) before closing it. NEVER close an issue directly on PR merge without linking a released version.

## Engineering workflow rules (lock-in 2026-08-10)

Rules learned the hard way during the two-issue/two-PR batch of 2026-08-10.
Follow them so future work doesn't re-burn the same turns.

A concise mirror of these rules — including the CHANGELOG voice rule — lives in
the global agent guidelines: `~/.claude/AGENTS.md` -> `## CHANGELOG, PRs e merges`
(symlinked from `.codex-shared/AGENTS.md`, so Claude, Codex and OpenCode all load it).

### CHANGELOG: PR credit is mandatory

- Every merged PR's user-facing work appears in `## Unreleased` **and** carries
  author credit. Standard form (already applied for #76/#77):

  ```
  Thanks to [@davidagostini](https://github.com/davidagostini) for <what> — see PRs
  [#76](https://github.com/lennix1337/Genexus18MCP/pull/76) and
  [#77](https://github.com/lennix1337/Genexus18MCP/pull/77).
  ```

  This is the project standard, not optional. If a PR's entry lands without
  credit, add the Thanks line before the release is cut.

### Merging multiple PRs

- Two PRs that both edit `CHANGELOG.md` `## Unreleased` conflict on merge
  **regardless of order**. Plan for it: probe first with `git merge-tree
  --write-tree` (first PR) and a `git commit-tree` simulation (second PR, on a
  simulated first merge) — both are read-only and never touch the working tree.
- For a fork PR: merge locally in a temp worktree, resolve the `## Unreleased`
  block (combine `### Added` → `### Fixed` → `### Internal` in project order,
  preserving CRLF), commit with the canonical `Merge pull request #N from
  owner/branch` message so GitHub marks the PR **MERGED** (not just Closed),
  then push `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main` (never a bare
  `git push origin main` from a detached worktree — it pushes the stale local
  branch ref).
- After any manual main update, sync the local branch by **rebase** onto
  `origin/main`; expect a CHANGELOG conflict and resolve by combining sections.

### Adding a tool: semantic-cache invalidation duty

- Any NEW tool that mutates KB state **MUST** be registered in
  `Program.IsMutatingTool` (`src/GxMcp.Gateway/Program.ToolPayload.cs`), or the
  semantic cache serves stale reads until the gateway restarts (observed:
  `genexus_read part=Structure` kept returning a deleted object's content with
  the identical correlationId because `genexus_delete_object` wasn't recognised
  as mutating).
- Mechanics: `Program._semanticCache` replays the first successful read per
  `(kbAlias, tool, args)`; errors are never cached; a mutation clears the whole
  cache. Keys are KB-scoped (`cKey = "{kbAlias}|{tool}:{args}"`).
- Enforcement: extend `SemanticCacheInvalidationTests` with the new tool and its
  read-only counterparts — the test is what catches a miss (it caught
  `genexus_save_as`). Name-substring verbs cover edit/create/refactor/variable;
  action-gated tools (`gxserver`, `transfer`, `structure`, `db`, `lifecycle`,
  `properties`) need explicit action checks against the `tool_definitions.json`
  enums.

### Proving fixes against a real KB (HTTP live validation)

Unit tests are not enough for SDK-behaviour fixes. Prove against a real KB over
Streamable HTTP with a scratch gateway:

1. Build Gateway+Worker to `bin/Debug` (has the fresh code).
2. Write a throwaway config: `HttpPort` e.g. 5001, `McpStdio: false`,
   `WorkerExecutable` → `src/GxMcp.Worker/bin/Debug/GxMcp18.Worker.exe`,
   `Environment.KBPath` → a scratch KB (`C:\KBs\KBTeste`).
3. Launch `GxMcp18.Gateway.exe` from `bin/Debug/net8.0-windows` with
   `GX_CONFIG_PATH` set (PowerShell `Start-Process`). The launcher basher will
   hit the 30s timeout — that's expected (the child holds the pipe); verify the
   port in a follow-up call.
4. Handshake: `POST /mcp` `initialize` → reuse the `MCP-Session-Id` header;
   responses may be SSE (`data:` frames); tool text is JSON-in-JSON
   (`result.content[0].text`).
5. Drive the flow (create → read → delete → read). For persistence claims run a
   **cold cycle** (kill gateway → relaunch → reopen) so the semantic cache can't
   mask a real read.
6. Clean up: delete test objects, close the KB, kill the scratch gateway, remove
   temp files. Never touch the user's running npm/stdio gateways — identify by
   command line (npm ones live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\npm-cache\_npx\...`).

### Bash-on-Windows gotchas (each burned multiple turns)

- `$env:VAR=...` and `$_` inside a double-quoted PowerShell command get
  eaten/expanded by bash — single-quote the whole PS command string.
- Native Windows Python can't see `/tmp/...` paths — use `cygpath -w` or the
  real `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp` path.
- `taskkill` needs double slashes in Git Bash: `taskkill //PID 123 //F`.
- Long-lived spawned processes keep the basher's pipe open → the command times
  out even though the spawn succeeded. Treat the timeout as expected and verify
  state in the next call.
- `git merge-tree` / `git commit-tree` simulate merges without touching the
  working tree.

## Permissions granted to the assistant

Each entry must include: **trigger** (the precise condition that activates the
permission), **action** (what the assistant may do), and **rationale** (why this
is preferable to asking). Permissions should be reviewed quarterly to catch
broad rules that accumulate over time.

### Kill the Gateway/Worker when they lock build outputs

- **Trigger:** `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` fails with `MSB3027` or `MSB3021`
  citing `GxMcp18.Gateway.exe` or `GxMcp18.Worker.exe` as the locking process.
- **Action:** kill **by PID, after confirming the executable path points into
  this repo**. Never by image name:

  ```bash
  # the PID is in the MSB3027 message; confirm it before killing
  wmic process where "ProcessId=<pid>" get ExecutablePath
  taskkill //PID <pid> //F        # double slashes in Git Bash
  ```

- **NOT this:** `Stop-Process -Name GxMcp18.Gateway,GxMcp18.Worker -Force` or
  `taskkill /IM ... /F`. Observed 2026-08-15: the machine was running **five**
  `GxMcp.Gateway` processes from the npx production install plus a `Gx16Mcp`
  pair for the GeneXus 16 server. A name match would have killed the user's
  live MCP sessions to fix a lock held by one scratch build. The lock is always
  held by a specific PID, and that PID is in the error message — there is never
  a reason to broaden it to a name.
- **Rationale:** the *scratch* gateway/worker are the assistant's own dev
  processes; pausing to ask each time adds friction without protecting
  anything. The user's npx/production instances are NOT covered by this
  permission even though they share an image name.
- **Out of scope:** killing by image name, killing anything whose
  `ExecutablePath` is outside this repo (npx cache, `Genexus16MCP`, GeneXus IDE,
  Visual Studio), force-killing build daemons under a different user,
  force-killing anything when no MSB lock error is present.
- **Granted:** 2026-05-15 by user. Last reviewed: 2026-08-15 (narrowed from
  name-match to PID-match after the five-instance observation above).

## Self-update protocol (LLM-facing)

When an AI agent connects to this MCP, it can — and should — proactively check whether the server it's running against is up to date.

### How to check

Call `genexus_whoami`. The response includes an `update` block:

```json
"update": {
  "currentVersion": "2.5.0",
  "latestVersion": "2.5.3",
  "updateAvailable": true,
  "checkedAt": "2026-05-19T19:22:00Z",
  "releaseUrl": "https://github.com/lennix1337/Genexus18MCP/releases/tag/v2.5.3",
  "command": "npx genexus-mcp@latest init",
  "restartRequired": true
}
```

The check is performed by the gateway in the background on `initialize`, cached for 24h in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GenexusMCP\update-check.json`. `whoami` just reads the cache — instant, no network round-trip on the user's tool call.

### What the LLM should do

- **On the first `whoami` of a session**, look at `update.updateAvailable`. If `true`, surface it to the user in plain language: *"Heads up — GeneXus MCP v{latestVersion} is out (you're on v{currentVersion}). Release notes: {releaseUrl}. Want me to install it?"*
- **If the user agrees**, run the upgrade via the Bash / shell tool the client provides. The exact command lives in `update.command` (default `npx genexus-mcp@latest init`); pass the user's KB and GeneXus paths from `whoami.kb.path` and `whoami.geneXus.installationPath` if running the non-interactive form: `npx genexus-mcp@latest init --kb "<kb>" --gx "<gx>"`.
- **Then tell the user to fully restart the AI client.** The gateway can't hot-reload itself (it's the process the client spawned); the new binaries are picked up on the next launch. `update.restartRequired` is the explicit signal.
- **Do not auto-update without asking.** Installs touch the user's MCP client config and the user expects to see the upgrade prompt before paths change.
- **Don't nag.** Mention the available update once per session, not on every tool call. The cached `checkedAt` is your hint — if it's the same value as a few turns ago, the user has been told.

### When the update check is disabled

Set environment variable `GENEXUS_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the background check entirely. Some corporate networks block GitHub API; in those cases `update` returns `{currentVersion, updateAvailable: false, note: "no update-check yet ..."}` and the LLM should respect the absence and not pester.

> All runtime environment variables (HTTP token, GAM credentials, AI-completion proxy, build-path and diagnostic knobs) are catalogued in [`docs/environment_variables.md`](docs/environment_variables.md).

## Tool playbook — v2.6.6 additions

Discoverable via `tools/list`; full schema in `src/GxMcp.Gateway/tool_definitions.json`. Each entry below is a 2-3 line orientation for the LLM agent.

- **`genexus_lifecycle action=status wait=<sec> since=<baseline>`** — event-driven progress. Worker blocks on the task's `ManualResetEventSlim` and returns the moment the state transitions out of `baseline` (or `wait` seconds elapse). Replaces 1-2s polling loops.
- **`genexus_history action=restore discard=true target=<obj>`** — IDE-parity Discard-changes. Restores the part bytes from the most recent `EditSnapshotStore` entry under `.gx/snapshots/`; no commit / rollback / VCS round-trip. Envelope surfaces `restoredFrom` (timestamp + snapshot path).
- **`genexus_preview action=run`** — F5 launcher. Resolves the KB's startup object via `KbService.GetLauncherObjectName` (`StartupObject` env property → `DefaultObject` fallback) and opens it in the headless bridge. No `target` argument required.
- **`genexus_analyze mode=parent_context target=<webpanel>`** — popup-vs-standalone classification. Returns `{ openedAs: "popup"|"standalone", hint }` so the agent knows whether the panel was generated for `genexus_create_popup` or as a top-level screen. The same `popupHint` is inlined into the create_popup response so both sides agree on the first call.

## Tool playbook — v2.6.9 additions (Wave 3 + Futures-promoted)

These 18 tools graduated from `DEFERRED`/`Future` stubs into live services. Each is a 2-line orientation; full schema lives in `tool_definitions.json`.

- **`genexus_tutorial step=N`** — static 6-step walkthrough (orient → list → inspect → read → edit → build). Call once on a fresh session; returns `{title, narrative, suggestedCall, next}`. No KB state.
- **`genexus_watch_event target=<obj> event=<name>`** — filters the in-memory `OperationTracker` for runs against `target` whose payload mentions `event`. Returns `{runs:[…]}`. Not a runtime breakpoint; resets on gateway restart.
- **`genexus_learning action=report`** — aggregates `.gx/friction.jsonl` (written by `genexus_friction_log`) into `{totalEntries, byTool[], byCode[], severityHistogram}`. Read-only; pair with `genexus_friction_log action=tail` for raw lines.
- **`genexus_sd_panel action=inspect|create|edit name=<sdpanel>`** — type-locked SDPanel entry for mobile-first agents. Rejects non-SDPanel targets. Returns the underlying envelope tagged `kind="SDPanel"`.
- **`genexus_multi_agent_lock action=acquire|release|status target=<obj> ownerId=<id>`** — advisory file lock per `(kbPath, target, part)` under `.gx/locks`. Auto-expires after `ttlSec` (default 300, max 86400). Use before edits when multiple agents may collide.
- **`genexus_what_if change={kind,target,attribute,oldType,newType}`** — read-only impact preview. Walks `ImpactAnalysis` callers + source-substring scan; cross-family type swaps (Numeric ↔ Character) flagged as breaks. Returns `{breaks[], probably_safe[], unknown[]}`.
- **`genexus_voice transcript="add button called Save"`** — maps NL transcripts to a suggested tool call via built-in regex intents (add button, rename X to Y, build all, screenshot X, list transactions, …). Returns `{matched, dispatchedTool, dispatchedArgs}`. Agent confirms; no dispatch.
- **`genexus_ai_complete context=<prompt>`** — forwards the prompt to an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint (env `GXMCP_AI_COMPLETE_URL`/`_KEY`/`_MODEL`). Returns `{completion, tokensIn, tokensOut, model}` or `{code:"AiEndpointNotConfigured"}` when env unset.
- **`genexus_time_travel name=<obj> at=<ISO-or-sha>`** — recovers an object's part bytes from a past git commit. `at=<ISO>` resolves to most-recent commit ≤ timestamp; `at=<sha>` is direct. Read-only; returns `{recoveredFromCommit, parts:[{path,content}]}` or `KbNotInGit`.
- **`genexus_auto_test action=generate_from_prod_log path=<jsonl>`** — reads `{atUtc,tool,target,params}` lines, dedupes by tool×target, emits GXtest stub source. Returns `{linesRead, stubsGenerated:[{name,source}], skipped[]}`. Nothing written to the KB.
- **`genexus_reverse_pattern action=infer source=[X,Y,…]`** — intersects variables / events / parm-signatures across ≥2 objects to flag pattern candidates. Returns `{commonVariables[], commonEvents[], commonParmSignature, divergencePoints[], hint}`. Does NOT emit a real pattern.
- **`genexus_cross_browser target=<webpanel>`** — resolves the runtime URL once, then renders in chrome (via `chrome-devtools-axi`) and firefox/webkit (via `npx playwright`) in parallel. Returns `{url, results:[{browser,ok,screenshotPath,consoleErrors,ms}], anyFailed}`. Per-browser `{skipped:true,code:"BrowserDriverUnavailable"}` when a driver is missing.
- **`genexus_rename_across_kb from=<name> to=<name> type=Attribute?`** — KB-wide rename. Patches every call-site found via the index's `CalledBy` edges by routing through `RefactorService.Rename{Object|Attribute}`. Returns the standard refactor envelope with patched-site count.
- **`genexus_kb_diff kbA=<alias-or-path> kbB=<alias-or-path>`** — gateway-side filesystem diff between two KB roots. Walks `Objects/<Type>/<Name>/`; no SDK touch. Returns `{onlyInA[], onlyInB[], modified[]}`. For SDK-level inspection use `genexus_inspect`.
- **`genexus_worker_pool action=warm_spares spareCount=N`** — gateway lifecycle knob: pre-spawns N warm workers bound to declared KBs so the first KB-bound call doesn't pay cold-start. `spareCount<=0` disables; capped at 5. Returns `{status, spareCount, configured}`.
- **`genexus_sandbox action=create from=<alias> name=<id>`** — gateway-side filesystem clone of a KB to `<configRoot>/sandboxes/<name>/` for throwaway edits. `action=remove` is idempotent; `overwrite=true` replaces. Returns `{status, path, filesCopied, bytesCopied, alias}`. Open the sandbox with `genexus_kb action=open path=<path> alias=sandbox-<name>`.
- **`genexus_github action=create_pr title=<t> body=<b>`** — shells out to the `gh` CLI from the KB path (or `workingDir`). Returns `{status, url}` on success, `{code:"GhCliNotInstalled"}` when the CLI is missing, or `{code:"GhExitNonZero", exitCode, stderr}`.
- **`genexus_kb_import from=<alias> name=<obj> type=<TypeName>`** — gateway-side filesystem copy of one object's part files from another KB into the active KB. Dependencies NOT resolved. Returns `{status, filesCopied, targetDir}`. Must run `genexus_lifecycle action=index force=true` afterwards to make the imported object discoverable.

## Tool playbook — SDK-endpoint expansion (P0/P1/P2 + one P3)

Ten SDK capabilities wired from `docs/sdk_uncovered_endpoints_2026-07-20.md` (see `docs/sdk_endpoints_roadmap.md`). Several wrap services **not registered in the headless worker** — resolved by constructing the public concrete impl directly (`SdkServiceLocator.ConstructOrResolve`, see `reference_headless_service_registration_wall` and the roadmap's "wall" table). All live-verified over HTTP on a real KB.

- **`genexus_transfer action=export|inspect|import`** — real XPZ over `IKnowledgeManagerService` (dependency-aware, unlike the fs-copy `genexus_io`/`genexus_kb_import`). `export` needs `targets[]`+`outputFile`; `inspect file=<xpz>` explores without importing; `import` is destructive — `dryRun` defaults true (previews via ExploreExport), `dryRun=false` needs `confirm=true`.
- **`genexus_deploy action=list_targets|deploy`** — `IDeploymentService`/`IDeploymentTargetService`. `list_targets` (default, read-only) enumerates configured targets (AWS EB, Tomcat, IIS, …); `deploy` needs `confirm=true`.
- **`genexus_security action=scan_native`** — the SDK's own Security Scanner (`ISecurityScannerService.Scan` via a `SecurityScanPlan.GetForModel` plan + an `IScannerOuput` collector). Distinct from `scan_secrets` (regex) and `audit_gam` (env props).
- **`genexus_analyze mode=kb_stats`** — last object/table change + last reorg + derived `reorgLikelyNeeded` (`IModelInformationService`); optional per-object-type operation history with `typeGuid`.
- **`genexus_analyze mode=table_relations name=<Transaction>`** — associated table, other transactions on it, and redundant / possibly-redundant attributes (`ITablesService`; table read via `transaction.Structure.Root.AssociatedTable`).
- **`genexus_db action=reorg_impact`** — cheap timestamp heuristic by default; `deep=true` runs `ISpecifierService.ImpactDatabase` (specification, build-heavy). For the DDL SQL use `sql_ddl`.
- **`genexus_gxserver action=pipeline_list|pipeline_runs|pipeline_output|pipeline_run|pipeline_abort`** — CI pipelines over `IContinuousIntegrationService` on a GXserver-linked KB. `pipeline_run`/`pipeline_abort` need `confirm=true`; off a linked KB returns `{connected:false}`.
- **`genexus_gxserver action=ignored`** (+ `ignoredForCommit` on `action=pending`) — the IDE's Commit > "Ignored Objects" set. Read from each object's `ModelEntityOutput` type `505` in the design model (the marker the IDE writes for "Add to 'Ignored Objects'"); the Common `ITeamDevClientService` has no ignore read and the UI.Framework one won't resolve headless. Full reverse-engineering + reproducible capture recipe: [`docs/teamdev_commit_ignore_505.md`](docs/teamdev_commit_ignore_505.md).
- **`genexus_layout action=list_controls`** — control-definition catalog (user controls + built-ins) via `IUserControlsManagerService`.
- **`genexus_layout action=design_system [name=<DSO>]`** — a Design System Object's token groups, theme classes, images and referenced DSOs (`DesignSystemHelper`). Omit `name` to use the first DSO. Read-only (DSO write ops exist in the SDK but aren't wired).
- **`genexus_create action=curl_procedure name=<Proc> curl="curl …"`** — scaffold a REST-consumer Procedure from a curl command (`ICurlGeneratorService`, IDE "Import from cURL").

`genexus_create type=API` scaffolds a REST API object; the Source is a route table
the GeneXus specifier parses. The grammar (reverse-engineered against GeneXus 18.0.7):

```
Verb { <route> => <Object>; <route2> => <Object2>; }
```

- Routes on the LHS are **bare identifiers** (not quoted string literals).
- The mapped object is on the RHS, separated by `=>` (not `:`), each rule `;`-terminated.
- **One HTTP-verb block per API object.** A second top-level verb block fails at
  spec (`Get {…} Post {…}` → `mismatched input 'Post' expecting <EOF>`), and a
  `@Post`/`@Get` decorator inside a block fails (`mismatched input '@'`). This is
  the GeneXus grammar itself, not an MCP restriction — the MCP does not rewrite it.
- To expose multiple verbs on the same resource, use **per-procedure REST**
  (set the Procedure's `REST=True` / `Expose as ...`) reached at `<app>/rest/<ProcName>`,
  rather than trying to mix verbs in one API object.

### Folder / module placement (SDK-backed since v2.35.0)

Objects **can** be placed into a Folder or Module through the tools — the same
operation as KB Explorer drag-and-drop / right-click → Move in the IDE.

- **Move an existing object:** `genexus_properties action=move name=<obj>
  destination=<Folder or Module>`. For a Module, `targetModule=<name>` is the
  typed alias. The container kind is auto-detected; pass
  `destKind=Folder|Module` only to disambiguate a shared name. `dryRun=true`
  previews `from` / `to`, preserved parts and hashes without writing or changing
  the `versionToken`.
- **Write-back is verified completely.** Pass the opaque `versionToken` from a
  prior read as `baseVersion`. The operation snapshots every persisted part and
  authored property, compares them inside the SDK transaction, then re-reads the
  committed object. A dropped parent returns `MoveNotPersisted`; changed content
  returns `MoveContentNotPreserved`; neither can report success. With
  `rollbackOnFailure=true` (default), parent and content are restored and verified.
- **No implicit lifecycle work.** Move never runs Specify, Generate, Build,
  Rebuild, compilation, reorganization, execution, or tests.
- **Create directly in a container:** `genexus_create … folder=<name>` or
  `module=<name>` creates the object in Root Module and then moves it, reporting
  the outcome under `placement`.
- **`action=set` on a placement property is routed, not rejected.**
  `propertyName=Folder|FolderId|FolderGuid|Module|ModuleId|Parent|ParentKey|ParentId`
  is recognised as a reparent (`PropertyService.IsObjectPlacementProperty`) and
  dispatched to `ObjectService.MoveObject` instead of a scalar property write.
- **`list` / `inspect` re-file immediately** — `IndexCacheService.InvalidateHierarchy`
  drops the per-Guid hierarchy cache and the old parent's `ChildrenByParent` slot
  before the index entry is updated.

Create the containers themselves with `genexus_create type=Folder|Module`.

> **Why the SDK looks like it can't do this.** `KBObject`'s `Parent` / `ParentKey` /
> `Module` setters *do* read as empty stubs at the IL level — but only in the
> facade/reference assembly. Decompiling that assembly is what produced the
> earlier "placement is unsupported" verdict. The runtime persist goes through
> `Artech.Udm.Framework.EntityManager.UpdateParent` (see
> `src/GxMcp.Worker/Helpers/ObjectMover.cs`). `SaveWithParent` and `KBObject.Save`
> are compatibility fallbacks guarded by full snapshot verification. Don't
> re-derive the old conclusion from a reference-assembly
> decompile.

### Control-bound events must be written AFTER the layout

A control-bound event (`Event &Ctrl.Click`, `&Ctrl.ControlValueChanged`, `&Ctrl.Display=…`)
references a control that must already exist in the projected form, or the SDK rejects
it with `src0233`/`src0216`. Write the layout / apply the PatternInstance **first**, then
the Events part. Also: a `userAction name="Foo"` auto-generates an empty `Event 'DoFoo'`
stub — **fill that stub**, don't add a second `Event 'DoFoo'` (that collides with
`src0208 "event already defined"`). Write errors carrying these codes now surface the
actionable hint inline; see `WritePolicy.BuildEventDiagnosticHint`.

### SDPanel (Smart Device Panel) parts are WorkWithDevices projections (issue #29)

An `SDPanel` is not a plain object with self-contained parts — it's driven by the
WorkWithDevices pattern. Its parts are `Artech.Patterns.WorkWithDevices.Parts.Virtual*Part`
projections, and their GUIDs differ from the Web equivalents (leading hex nibble masked,
e.g. Web Events `c44bd5ff-…` → SD Events `144bd5ff-…`). Consequences the tools now handle:

- **Readable:** `SDEvents` (the panel's event code) and `SDRules` are `ISource` virtual
  parts and read fine. They are surfaced in `availableParts`, and `part=Source`/`Events`
  resolves to `SDEvents` (previously it hit `SDRules`, which is almost always empty — the
  source of the "reads empty" report). `part=SDEvents` / `part=SDRules` also work by name.
- **Not extractable:** `SDLayout`, `SDVariables`, `SDConditions` are non-`ISource` virtual
  parts. `SerializeToXml()` returns an empty `<Properties />` even when the panel has
  content, because the data is projected from the pattern, not stored on the part. Reading
  one now returns `projected:true` + a `note` explaining this — an empty result here does
  **not** mean the panel is empty. Layout/variables are authored in the GeneXus IDE.

## Release discipline

> **HARD RULE — releases require the maintainer's explicit go-ahead, every time.**
> Do **not** run `./release.ps1`, create a tag, or publish a GitHub Release
> because you judged the work "done" or "ready to ship". A release happens
> **only** when the maintainer explicitly says to release *this* change (e.g.
> "sobe a 2.26.1", "pode soltar", "release it"). Implementing, building, and
> testing a change is authorized by the task; **shipping it is a separate,
> explicit decision that is the maintainer's alone.** Finishing the code is not
> permission to release — when in doubt, stop after tests pass and ask. Approval
> for one release never carries to the next.

- Before any release (`./release.ps1`, tag, or GitHub Release), update
  `CHANGELOG.md` with an entry for the exact version being released.

### One-shot release command

Cutting a release is a single command — `./release.ps1` handles version
bumps, build, zip, commit, tag, push, and `gh release create` (with
`publish.zip` attached **in the same API call** as create):

```powershell
.\release.ps1 -Version 2.6.9         # full bump → build → ship
.\release.ps1                        # no version bump; use current package.json
.\release.ps1 -Version 2.6.9 -DryRun # rehearse without touching origin
```

**Don't** run `gh release create` by hand. The workflow at
`.github/workflows/release.yml` expects a `publish.zip` asset on the
release; creating without the asset publishes a release that the
workflow fails on with `publish.zip missing` (the script attaches it in
one call so the workflow's first `release.published` event succeeds).

The Worker can't build on GitHub-hosted runners (it references Artech.\*
DLLs from a local GeneXus 18 install which isn't on `ubuntu-latest`),
so the zip has to be produced on a Windows machine with GeneXus
installed. `release.ps1` does this.

### npmjs.com webpage lag after publish

After `release.ps1` finishes and the workflow turns green, the package
is live on the npm **registry** immediately:

```powershell
npm view genexus-mcp version            # → 2.6.8 right away
npm view genexus-mcp dist-tags --json   # { "latest": "2.6.8" }
npm install -g genexus-mcp@latest       # gets 2.6.8
```

The npmjs.com **website** (`npmjs.com/package/genexus-mcp`) is served
from a separate CDN that caches the rendered page and **can lag the
registry by 10–30 minutes**. The right-sidebar "Version" label and the
"Published N hours ago" line can still show the previous version even
when the README badge (`shields.io`, queries the live registry) already
shows the new one. This is a known npmjs.com UI quirk, not a publish
failure. Don't re-cut the release; just wait or verify via
`npm view` / `registry.npmjs.org/genexus-mcp/latest`.

When a user reports "still on old version after install", the actual
fixes (in order) are:

1. `where.exe genexus-mcp` — multiple matches mean an older install
   (e.g. from `install.ps1` build-from-source) is masking the npm one.
   Remove the non-npm copy from `PATH`.
2. `npm cache clean --force && npm uninstall -g genexus-mcp && npm install -g genexus-mcp@<version>` — pins past any cached metadata.
3. Confirm `genexus-mcp doctor` reports the expected version.

### CHANGELOG voice — release-facing, not roadmap-internal

**HARD RULE.** When this rule and any AI-agent generation reflex conflict,
this rule wins. Re-edit until each bullet survives a "would the end user
care?" reread. The same rule is mirrored (concisely) in the global agent guidelines — `~/.claude/AGENTS.md` is a symlink to `~/.codex-shared/AGENTS.md`, imported by `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) and shared with Codex/OpenCode — so it
applies to every project that ships a CHANGELOG.

Entries in `CHANGELOG.md` are read by users on GitHub Releases / npm /
package pages — they should describe **what the user gets**, not how the
sausage was made. Follow these rules:

- **Lead with user-facing capability**, not internal nomenclature. "**`genexus_preview`** — render a WebPanel via headless Chrome..." not "**W4 — Render preview implementation**".
- **No roadmap / workstream codes** (W1, W2, FR#3, SP4.T5, etc.) in the user-facing portion. Cross-reference docs in a single line at the top of the version (`See docs/mcp-roadmap-ide-parity.md for design context.`) if relevant; never sprinkle codes through the bullets.
- **No internal-only context** in user-facing bullets: friction-report cross-references, session narratives, code-archeology asides, "post-roadmap status" tables, agent IDs, commit hashes. Keep those for `docs/` and PR descriptions.
- **Use the four standard sections** (in this order, omit unused ones): `### Added`, `### Fixed`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`. Plus `### Internal` at the **bottom** for engineer-only notes (test counts, schema-budget bumps, internal helper renames, fixture regen instructions).
- **One bullet per capability**, lead bold-name (tool / class / behavior), then 1–4 sentences of plain English. No CLR type dumps in the user-facing copy — link them under `### Internal` if needed.
- **Concrete example values** when they aid comprehension (`"AttributeBlue"`, `Class="…"`), not opaque GUIDs unless the bug was about GUIDs.
- **Past tense for fixes** ("Raw-XML writes that emitted `OnClickEvent=…` were silently ignored…"); imperative-or-present for new features ("Apply a GeneXus pattern… ").
- **Don't reference KB-specific names** (Maria Daiane, AcademicoHomolog1, dani.aspx) in the changelog. The release goes out to everyone; their KB has different objects.
- **Don't claim test counts in the user-facing section.** Test counts and skipped-test caveats go under `### Internal`.

Compare these two takes on the same fix:

> ❌ Roadmap-internal voice
> #### W1 — SDK-routed layout writes (gxButton OnClickEvent fix)
> **`gxButton` custom `OnClickEvent` now wires correctly in WebForm-html.** Friction-report 2026-05-19 #1 root cause: the SDK maps the descriptor name `OnClickEvent` to a per-element XML attribute (gxButton → `Event`, gxAttribute/gxImage → `eventGX`). Raw-XML writes that emit `OnClickEvent=` literally are silently dropped by the HTML generator. Fix: `WebFormTypedPropertyWriter.ApplyDescriptorPathFixup(part)` — post-write hook that walks every IWebTag and routes any descriptor-name attribute through `Artech.Common.Properties.PropertiesObject.SetPropertyValue` / `SetPropertyValueString` via reflection.

> ✅ Release-facing voice
> ### Fixed
> **`gxButton OnClickEvent` for custom events.** Raw-XML writes that emitted `OnClickEvent="'MyEvent'"` were silently ignored by the HTML generator, which only reads the per-element XML attribute the SDK assigns (`Event` for `gxButton`, `eventGX` for `gxAttribute` / `gxImage`). The MCP now routes descriptor-named properties through the SDK's typed property API so the canonical XML attribute is emitted. Applies on every layout save; idempotent.

When in doubt, re-read the entry as if you were a developer who just installed the package and is wondering what changed — would they care about this sentence? If not, demote to `### Internal` or delete.
